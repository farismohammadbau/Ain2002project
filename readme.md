# Stroke Chance Prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for stroke chances based on various risk factors. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, the model predicts the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke, providing valuable insights for preventive healthcare strategies.

## Requirements

To run this project, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Download the Train Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) and place it in the project directory as **healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv**.
- [Download the Synthetic Train and Test Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e2/data) and place it in the project directory as **train.csv**, **test.csv** for the train and test datasets respectively.

Additionally, you will need the following Python libraries:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `predict.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the stroke chance prediction model.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file specifying the required Python libraries and their versions.
- `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv.csv`: Train dataset for model training and evaluation.
- `train.csv`: Synthetic train dataset for additional training.
- `test.csv`: Synthetic test dataset for additional model validation.
  
## Usage

To use the Stroke Chance Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have installed all the necessary dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `predict.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code, load the dataset, train the model, and make predictions.

4. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or model evaluation methods.

5. Analyze the results, including accuracy metrics, visualizations, and any other relevant outputs generated by the notebook.

## Future Work

While the current model achieves satisfactory results, there are several improvement that could be done:

- **Further Analysis**: Conduct in-depth analysis of feature importance, correlation, and contribution to stroke prediction to gain more insights into the underlying factors.

- **Real-world Validation**: Validate the model's performance using external datasets or conduct a retrospective analysis on patient data from healthcare institutions.
